# Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2026-02-19

This Privacy Policy explains how URL Inbox handles data.

## 1. What this app stores
URL Inbox stores the following data locally on your device:
- Saved links (URL, title, description, image metadata)
- Tags, folders, notes, and read/star/archive states
- Optional settings (theme, clipboard detection, reminder toggle)

## 2. Where data is stored
- All saved content is stored locally on device storage (SQLite and local preferences).
- The app can be used without account sign-in for local-only usage.
- Optional sign-in enables cloud sync across devices when configured.

## 3. Network access
To enrich link previews, the app may fetch webpage metadata from shared or saved URLs.
This may include requests to third-party websites such as social platforms and news/blog pages.

## 4. Data sharing
- The app does not sell personal data.
- By default, local-only usage does not upload your saved link database to a remote server.
- If cloud sync is enabled and you sign in, saved links and related metadata are synchronized to your configured Supabase backend.

## 5. Notifications
If reminders are enabled, local notifications are scheduled on your device based on unread link count.

## 6. Permissions
- Internet access: required for metadata fetch and opening links.
- Notification permission (platform-dependent): required for reminder alerts.

## 7. Your choices
You can:
- Delete saved links, folders, and tags in-app
- Disable clipboard detection
- Disable reminders

## 8. Children
This app is not directed to children under the applicable age in your region.

## 9. Contact
